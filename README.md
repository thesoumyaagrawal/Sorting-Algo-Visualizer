# Future Scope
Incorporate animations: While the current functionality effectively demonstrates algorithm behaviors, the addition of dynamic animations during processes like element swapping and movement could significantly enhance the visual appeal of the application.

Enhance the visual design: To elevate the website's aesthetics, it's advisable to reconsider the existing design elements. This entails exploring a more vibrant color palette and introducing more sophisticated geometric shapes, as the current design might be perceived as somewhat plain.

Expansion into graph algorithms: There's a valuable opportunity to broaden the application's scope by incorporating graph algorithms into its repertoire. This extension would further enrich the app's capabilities and offer users insights into a wider range of algorithmic concepts.
