## Vue Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
Inspired by VisuAlgo, the app aims to help beginners understand sorting algorithms by visualizing them. Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, count sort and radix sort are available as of now.

## Features
* Visualize seven popular and commonly taught sorting algorithms
* Randomly generate array
* Change input array manually
* Change animation speed

## Used technologies
* Vue
* HTML
* CSS

## Future improvements
* **Add animations**: although the current implementation does a good job at visualizing the algorithms, adding some animations such as when swapping and moving elements would make the app more appalling.
* **Improve design**: the current design of the website can come off as plain due to the somehow dull color palette and simple geometric shapes.
* **Graph algorithms**: the app could be extended so that it would cover graph algorithms as well.

# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
"Explore sorting algorithms visually! This mini project, built with JavaScript and Vue, showcases Merge Sorting, Selection Sorting, Quick Sorting, Insertion Sorting and Bubble sorting. Gain insights into sorting techniques through interactive visualizations. A hands-on learning experience!"
# Technology Used
Vue.js
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
# Outcomes Of the Project
By incorporating dynamic animations into the algorithm visualization app, users will experience a more interactive and engaging learning environment. This will lead to improved user retention and a more effective learning experience, as users grasp complex concepts more readily through visual cues.

# Future Scope of Improvements
Incorporate animations: While the current functionality effectively demonstrates algorithm behaviors, the addition of dynamic animations during processes like element swapping and movement could significantly enhance the visual appeal of the application.

Enhance the visual design: To elevate the website's aesthetics, it's advisable to reconsider the existing design elements. This entails exploring a more vibrant color palette and introducing more sophisticated geometric shapes, as the current design might be perceived as somewhat plain.

Expansion into graph algorithms: There's a valuable opportunity to broaden the application's scope by incorporating graph algorithms into its repertoire. This extension would further enrich the app's capabilities and offer users insights into a wider range of algorithmic concepts.
